# ERPConnect
**A single place to redirect to everything related to ERP. **

Why do we need it?
To this day navigating to or finding the application is challenging at best. Most of the time we are called by our co workers to help them assist in finding the application. Especially the User Access Request form. This can be due to the fact these forms are indirectly available in Intranet. 
This is especially difficult for new staff that join our company. The most effortless strategy would be to inform our employees to bookmark the links in their browser but knowing our company, thatâ€™s easier said than done.
